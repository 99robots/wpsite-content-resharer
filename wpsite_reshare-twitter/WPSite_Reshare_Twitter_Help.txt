\
How do I setup my twitter account?\
\'a0 \'a0 \'a0\
\'a0 \'a0 \'a0Before WPSite Reshare can automatically tweet for you, we need you to create a twitter developer account. \'a0By creating this account you can link your site to your twitter account and allow WPSite Reshare to automatically post for you. \'a0Go to this link to create an twitter developer account\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://dev.twitter.com/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://dev.twitter.com}}. Then create a twitter developer application by going to this link\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://dev.twitter.com/apps"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://dev.twitter.com/apps}}. \'a0After that is done and you set your Access Level Capabilities to "Read and Write\'94 (see FAQ), then copy and paste all your keys, secrets, and tokens (see FAQ) into your new WPSite Reshare twitter account. \'a0Once that is done set your post filter settings,(see Trouble Shooting section on Help page for Post Filtering) making sure to include some post types and to not exclude all categories. \'a0Finally your ready to test your account! \'a0Go to the Accounts page and hover your newly created account. \'a0Under the \'93Minimum Interval\'94 column there will be a link that says \'93reshare now\'94, click it. \'a0Once this is done check your twitter feed to see your new tweet (if not go to Trouble Shooting section on Help page).\'a0\
\
What are messages?\
\
\'a0 \'a0 \'a0A message is the text you would like to include in the reshare content. \'a0It is highly recommended to create messages and lots of them to make WPSite Reshare posts seems more humanlike. \'a0When creating a message there is a preview to show you what an example post content could look like. \'a0Messages are totally optional and the plugin will still post to the social channel if you have none.\
\

\b FAQ
\b0 \
\
Why do I have to create a twitter developer application to use this plugin?\'a0\
\
Twitter just recently updated its application programming interface (API) to make it more safe for users to retrieve and post information. \'a0This also means that there are now more guidelines to follow and in order to tweet behind the scenes twitter needs to make sure you, are really you. \'a0What this means is that twitter needs for you to register with them as a developer so they know that when you get or post information, using that developer account, to twitter it is 100% you. \'a0What this means for you the end-user is that you need to do a little bit more to create this developer account, and then in turn create an application that will get and post information to twitter on your behalf. \'a0\'a0\
\
What is the "API Keys and Tokens" section in account settings page?\
\
This is where you will give WPSite Reshare your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret as well as the created Access Token and Access Token Secret. \'a0This is what will allow WPSite Reshare the ability to post information to twitter automatically on your behalf. \'a0Without this information nothing can be posted to twitter.\
\
Where can I find my Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret?\
\
All of this information will be available to you once your create a twitter developer account and then create an application. \'a0Once you create an application you can then go to this link {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://dev.twitter.com/apps"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://dev.twitter.com/apps}}\'a0to find all your applications. \'a0Choose the one you want to use and then Go to the \'93Details" tab. \'a0Under this tab you will see the "OAuth Settings" section. \'a0In this section you will find your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. \'a0Please copy and paste those to the related fields in the WPSite Reshare account settings page. \'a0Then go to the "Your Access Token\'94 section and first look at the Access Level field. \'a0This must have read and write capabilities, if you don\'92t have these capabilities then read more about "How do I get read and write Access Level capabilities?". \'a0Once you have read and write capabilities please copy and paste the Access Token and Access Token Secret to the related field in the WPSite Reshare plugin account settings page.\
\
How do I get read and write Access Level capabilities?\'a0\
\
First go to your twitter developer applications list from this link\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://dev.twitter.com/apps"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://dev.twitter.com/apps}}. \'a0Once there go to the application you are using with the WPSite Reshare plugin. \'a0Go to the \'93Settings\'94 tab and then scroll down to the "Application Type" Section. Check the "Read and Write" option and click \'93Update this Twitter application\'92s settings\'94. \'a0Now Go to the \'93Details\'94 tab and scroll down to the \'93Your Access Token\'94 section. \'a0Click on the \'93Recreate my access token\'94 button. \'a0If this new Access Level still says \'93Read Only\'94 then, please try a again after a few moments because twitter is still updating the settings you changed from the \'93Settings\'94 tab. \'a0Keeping trying until the Access Level says \'93Read and Write\'94. \'a0Now you can copy and paste the Access Token and Access Token Secret into the related accounts settings in the WPSite Reshare plugin.\
\
How do I exclude certain messages from certain posts? \'a0\'a0\
\
To exclude a message from a certain post go to that posts edit page. \'a0On the right side bar you will see a box that is Titled "WPSite Rehsare YourAccount\'94. \'a0Check and uncheck all your messages. \'a0All messages that are unchecked will never be used for that post.\'a0\
\
How do I create a custom message only for a specific post? \'a0\
\
To create a custom message related to a specific post go to that posts edit page. \'a0On the right side bar you will see a box that is Titled "WPSite Rehsare YourAccount\'94. \'a0In this box you can create custom messages only relating to this post.\
\
How is the reshare content created?\'a0\
\
The reshare content is created by using the settings in the \'93Rehare Content" section of your account to determine what the content will consist of. \'a0Posts are first filtered using the settings in the \'93Post Filter\'94 section in your account. \'a0Then a random post is chosen from these qualified posts. \'a0After that, a random message is chosen by first looking to see if there any custom messages relating to hat post. \'a0If so then randomly choose from those custom messages, if not then get all checked messages relating to this post and randomly chose one. \'a0If there are no checked messages then there will be no message in this reshare content. \'a0After the post and message are chosen, the content is created.\'a0\
\

\b Trouble-shooting Twitter Account
\b0 \
\
My Twitter account has not been tweeting at its intervals or at all.\
\
First check to see if the account is set to active, and all your post filters are valid. \'a0This is a very common problem so go through these steps to make sure your post filter settings are allowing for at least a couple posts to be selected. \'a0\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720
\ls1\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\'95	}Make sure your minimum and maximum age are valid and will return a list of posts. \'a0For example if you put your minimum age as 1 day and maximum age as 2 days, and you have no posts that were published in the last two days, then no posts can be selected and nothing will be reshared.\
{\listtext	\'95	}Make sure you have selected post types to include. \'a0This is found in the Accounts \'93Post Filter\'94 section.\
{\listtext	\'95	}Make sure to check to see if you have at least one box unchecked in the exclude posts in this category setting.\
{\listtext	\'95	}Go to the Exclude Posts page and make sure that all, if not most posts are included. \'a0All checked posts will be excluded when selecting a post to reshare.\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 If you have done the steps above and there are valid posts WPSite Reshare can chosen from then go to the Accounts page and make sure the "reshare now" works for the account. \'a0Hovering over the account under the \'93 Minimum Interval\'94 column there is a "reshare now" link. \'a0More on the \'93reshare now\'94 go to the Help page in the plugin. Click this link and look on your twitter account to see if anything was tweeted. \'a0\
\
\'a0 \'a0 \'a0If the "reshare now" worked and something was tweeted then the error is most likely a "duplicate status error" from twitter or a problem with the wordpress CRON job. \'a0The most common issue is that twitter won\'92t allow duplicate tweets in a set interval of time. \'a0If your blog only has a few of posts and you have only created a few or no messages, then WPSite Reshare could be trying to reshare the same content. \'a0A quick fix could be adding more messages to give your content more variety. \'a0If this doesn\'92t fix it then try downloading the WP Control plugin\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/}}. \'a0This shows you all wordpress cron jobs. \'a0Under the \'93Tools\'94 menu page in your blog admin panel, click on the submenu \'93Control\'94. \'a0This page will show all your CRON jobs. \'a0Here there should be CRON jobs with hooks called wpsite_reshare_*, which are all WPSite Reshare CRON jobs. \'a0If there are none, and the wpsite reshare account is set to active, then the CRON jobs are not scheduling. \'a0If this is so please contact kjbenk@gmail.com for further information.\
\
\'a0 \'a0 \'a0If the "reshare now" didn\'92t work then there is something wrong with your connection to your twitter account. \'a0First check to see if your Access Level Capabilities are set to "Read and Write\'94 (read more about that in the FAQ). \'a0If these the Access Level Capabilities are set to \'93Read and Write\'94, then maybe is has something to do with your Callback URL. \'a0Twitter will complain sometimes if a Callback URL is not set. \'a0This is only a twitter developer application bug and it will not affect your site at all. \'a0You can put a dummy Callback URL in this field which we recommend to be your main url. \'a0To set your Callback URL, go to your twitter application using this link\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://dev.twitter.com/apps"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://dev.twitter.com/apps}}\'a0and go to the \'93Settings\'94 tab. \'a0Under the \'93Application Type\'94 section you will see the Callback URL field. \'a0Put your url into this field e.g. http://example.com, and hit \'93Update this twitter application\'92s settings\'94.\
\
\'a0All errors should be found in the debug log if you want more information.\'a0\
